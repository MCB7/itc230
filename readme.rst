Summary
JavaScript is now widely used for full-stack web development, with Node.js allowing use of the same language for client & server applications. Front-end frameworks like React, Angular, and D3 are enabling new and exciting applications in the browser. 
  
This course will cover modern JavaScript technologies, including server-side scripting, automated testing, single-page web applications with MVC structure, package management, and JSON data storage. By quarter's end, students have built a fully-functional client-server application they can showcase for job applications.

**Requirements**

Students should have experience with basic web development skills, via WEB 150 or comparable experience, including:

- HTML and CSS
- Core JavaScript language syntax
- HTTP request/response methods
- JQuery selectors & methods

Students will perform extensive hands-on development throughout the course and will require;

- A computer onto which they can install software,
- A working internet connection
- A syntax-highlighting editor like Brackets or Sublime Text,
- A `github.com <https://github.com>`_ account

**Note** - ` AWS Cloud9 <https://aws.amazon.com/cloud9/>`_ provides free online development tools you can access from any computer via web browser.

This course will use **Web Development with MongoDB and Node, 3rd Ed.** as a textbook, and also supplementary online materials as needed. Students can access this text free online through Seattle Public Libraries.

Class Structure and Topics
  Each week, we'll cover a new topic, building on the previous week's work. In general we will cover new material in Monday lectures and exercise what we learned in Wednesday lab. We will cover the following topics, although the order and precise list is subject to revision:

- Introduction to Node.js - Overview & installation, NPM, modules
- Async. programming - Callbacks, events, asynchronous operations 
- Advanced JS concepts - ES6, higher-order functions, & promises
- Intro to Express and http request/response objects
- Express application structures - routes, views, and static files
- Unit testing 
- Templating with Handlebars 
- REST APIs & JSON
- Data storage with MongoDB
- Single-page-application (SPA) design with React

In general, you'll be given an assignment each Wednesday to exercise that week's topics. Assignments are due by the start of class on the following Tuesday.  Due to the shortened summer schedule, som assignments may overlap. These assignments allow me to evaluate your progress and will build toward a completed final project.

As such, most of your grade will come from turning in assignments on time and showing that you tried to solve it using your own original work. Your homework should be completely your own: plagiarism and late submissions will incur a grade penalty.

You should submit your assignments in Canvas as a link to your github.com repository url. You should use a single repository throughout the course, with clear a 'commit' message for each assignment completion.

90% of your grade will come from homework and  10% from quizzes.
